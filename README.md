The aim of this project was to have a test of my `JavaScript` skills, as well as to **improve it**. 

For this project I didn't use any ***framework, library, preprocessor or guide***. It was the result of **my own knowledge in `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript Vanilla`**. 

In this project I put into practice my knowledge of `CSS Grid` to be able to organize the buttons.
